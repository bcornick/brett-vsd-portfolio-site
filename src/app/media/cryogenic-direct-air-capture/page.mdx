### Week 4 of post series, "My Favorite Thing I Learned Last Week"

Microsoft is venturing into a novel territory by filing a patent for a "cryogenic direct air capture" system that essentially aims to freeze carbon solid from the atmosphere.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How it works:

- Air is drawn into a "recuperative heat exchanger" which cools it down to just above the carbon dioxide's "deposition point."
- This cold air is then exposed to a "deposition surface" cooled by a cryogenic refrigerator, turning CO2 into solid, which is then collected.
- Remaining air is released back, initiating the cycle once more.

### üí¨ Microsoft's stance:

- They emphasize the urgency of capturing atmospheric carbon to mitigate climate change impacts.
- Current "direct air capture" methods are expensive and energy-intensive.
- Their goal: Become carbon-negative by 2030 & neutralize their historical carbon footprint by 2050.

### ü§î Expert take:

- Dr. Dan Stein of Giving Green believes the idea is plausible in theory but wonders about its practical application and energy consumption.

### üìï Some context:

- Carbon removal is a challenge: Expensive, tough to scale, and potentially requiring vast amounts of land or resources.
- Big Tech, including Microsoft, acknowledges that merely reducing emissions isn't enough. The future lies in viable carbon removal techniques.
- Progress in the fight against climate change needs innovative approaches like this, but can this approach be scaled efficiently?

### ‚û°Ô∏è Side note:

As a part of my project in my Stochastic Studio course, I've set up an automation pipeline for myself that polls for newly published patents matching certain keywords and then uses GPT-4 to summarize the results. It was pretty satisfying for that pipeline to give me this gem on its first time running!
