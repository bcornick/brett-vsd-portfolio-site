### Episode description

Today's guests are Brett Cornick and Cam Nili, founders of Impact Finance. Impact Finance is decentralizing the scientific process to accelerate human progress, and to amplify the impact of the individual in the face of global challenges.

Impact Finance's mission is to empower users to own, trade, share, and create digital scientific assets in a decentralized ecosystem to make impactful advances in science and technology. Brett and Cam see a future where a purpose-built web3 platform enables science-based digital asset creators to cultivate their professional networks, track reputation, fund research, share inspiring ideas, and unlock new opportunities for collaboration and cooperation.

By providing researchers, investors, and communities with shared ownership and governance over the full scientific development lifecycle, the DeSci movement strives to make science more open-sourced and accessible to all. The status quo embodied by rigid data silos, censorship in publication, and inefficient funding processes will be a relic of the past.
