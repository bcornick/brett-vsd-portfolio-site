### Week 5 of post series, "My Favorite Thing I Learned Last Week"

Imagine the Earth equipped with a reflective shield that helps manage the effects of global warming. It sounds like far-fetched science fiction, but this is the general concept of Solar Radiation Management (SRM). It's a controversial, yet increasingly significant prospect discussed as a response to the accelerating climate crisis.

### üîé What is SRM?

SRM encompasses a set of techniques that aim to reflect a small proportion of the Sun's light and heat back into space, reducing the overall amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface. Increasing the Earth's ‚Äúalbedo‚Äù or, reflectiveness, is the primary objective. The attached image presents a pretty fantastical vision for SRM, but there are many more "subtle" techniques that could be deployed today. One example: artificial white clouds could be created via marine cloud brightening, where saltwater particles from the ocean are introduced into the cloud layer. Other suggestions include genetically engineering crops to have shinier leaves, utilizing reflective films on the ocean's surface, or introducing microbubbles into stationary water bodies.

### üèõ Governance is crucial:

SRM bears global ramifications. The questions of who governs its operation, who decides its usage based on which criteria, and who controls its outcomes are contentious. It's crucial to begin building a governance architecture surrounding SRM now, despite it still being at the discussion stage. SRM is not just a technical endeavor but a complex interaction of technological, scientific, and social forces, wrapped in the broader context of global efforts to understand and respond to climate change. We should invest in SRM governance with an anticipatory and flexible approach, ready for different possibilities that lie ahead.

### üåè Is it a solution?

While the intention behind SRM is to cool the planet, it's important to remember that it's not a fix-all solution. It could be part of a broader climate strategy but is not a shortcut around the more pressing need for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It's worth keeping a close watch on the SRM discussion as it plays a more central role in our efforts to take on climate change.
