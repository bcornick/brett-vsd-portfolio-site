## Overview

Deep tech ventures, characterized by cutting-edge scientific and technological innovations, can face unique hurdles when it comes to customer acquisition. Unlike SaaS or consumer startups, the adoption of deep tech solutions often requires a longer development and trial period due to the complexity and novelty of the technology involved. Potential customers are also likely to be more risk-averse when it comes to embracing unproven technologies. As a result, establishing the first customers and securing pilot projects is a momentous step in validating market potential and gaining traction for deep tech ventures. My chapter contribution aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key steps and strategies that founders should follow during this make-or-break phase of venture building.

To better understand how experienced deep tech founders navigate this process, I conducted a series of interviews following the Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) methodology. <strong>My diverse group of interviewees consisted of founders that are building solutions for low-carbon chemical development, plant-based metal mining, wildfire mitigation, micromobility, industrial decarbonization, and more.</strong> The challenges, solutions, and insights that they shared have equipped me with a confident approach towards deep tech customer acquisition, and I have done my best to honestly convey and synthesize their knowledge in this chapter.

## Covered topics

‣ The iterative nature of customer acquisition and its symbiotic relationship
with product development
