## Overview

I completed a techno-economic analysis to estimate the business viability of Nth Power's high-power-density containerized data centers. Their technology is modular, rapidly deployable, and purpose-built for grid operators to manage their growing AI workloads. Each data center also serves as a Distributed Energy Resource (DER) where wasted heat from server operation is captured, converted to electricity, and stored onsite for on-demand and orchestrated dispatch. This network of edge DERs operate in concert as a VPP, providing flexible grid balancing and frequency stabilization services to the grid operator in addition to AI-ready GPU cloud compute. Nth Power's data centers are built specifically for the regulatory and security needs of grid operators and utilities, enabling them to achieve the smart grid of tomorrow.

This analysis was done as part of my Techno-economics course during the Venture Science Doctorate program.

## Project outcomes

‣ Assessed the potential of Nth Power's technology to be economically feasible and competitive in the market

‣ Evaluated the associated with the development, production, and deployment of Nth Power's technology compared to its revenue generation capabilities

‣ Identified key drivers of cost and revenue to enable Nth Power to strategize on optimizing the production processes and scaling of operations

‣ Created a basis for Nth Power's technology development roadmap

‣ Presented as a tool for attracting investment and demonstrating potential returns
