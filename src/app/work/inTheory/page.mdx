## Overview

<strong>$16 trillion</strong>. That's the estimated size of the global funding
gap for scientific research. Nearly 85% of research proposals go unfunded every
year. Beyond that, the research that does get funded is not done so efficiently,
and researchers often spend more than half their time looking for new funding
sources. Few options exist today for interested individuals to actively support
scientific research in an engaging, transparent, and accessible way. This
disconnect between researchers and the broader community has led to poor
commercialization rates and a waning public trust in the scientific process.

inTheory Research presents an alternative method for science funding. By leveraging community momentum and the latest in web3 and generative AI technology, inTheory allows users to <em>own</em> a piece of the fundamental research they believe in by simply purchasing and collecting project-inspired digital artworks.

<strong>How did I contribute?</strong> Supported by my friend and co-founder, Cameron
Nili, I served as the sole researcher, designer, and developer of the inTheory funding
platform. In that capacity, I created all logos, mock-ups, and branding assets for
the platform, then subsequently wrote all front-end, back-end, and smart contract
code. I accomplished this despite having no previous background in digital design
or front-end development. Bootstrapped by the Angelblock Impact Startup grant, a
Gitcoin DeSci grant, and the Celo Camp Innovation Prize, we launched the beta platform
on the Celo and Polygon blockchains in early 2023.

<strong>Where is the project today?</strong> Unfortunately, this project never made
it past its beta testing phase. With an expected public launch in July 2023, we were
derailed by the rapid decline in seed-stage venture funding, coupled with a rising
skepticism in web3 technologies.

While this outcome was certainly not what we had hoped, I still
consider this project to be a failure that I take great pride in.

  Science is a public good, and yet the general public is barely involved in its
  funding and advancement. With inTheory, we hope to close this gap.
