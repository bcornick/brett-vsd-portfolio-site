## Overview

I completed a techno-economic analysis to estimate the business viability of Aether Thermal. Aether harvests the waste heat from high-performance data centers to charge low-temperature thermal batteries that can be distributed to heat consumers within local communities. This helps data center operators meet mandates for heat reuse and sustainability while improving public perception of their operations. Heat consumers, which include residential and commercial building operators, can use Aether's thermal batteries to decarbonize building heating and future-proof their properties.

This analysis was done as part of my Techno-economics course during the Venture Science Doctorate program.

## Project outcomes

‣ Assessed the potential of Aether Thermal's technology to be economically feasible and competitive in the market

‣ Evaluated the associated with the development, production, and deployment of Aether Thermal's technology compared to its revenue generation capabilities

‣ Identified key drivers of cost and revenue to enable Aether Thermal to strategize on optimizing the production processes and scaling of operations

‣ Created a basis for Aether Thermal's technology development roadmap

‣ Presented as a tool for attracting investment and demonstrating potential returns
